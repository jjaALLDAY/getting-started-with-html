<h1>Web Basics</h1>
<p>HTML text docs are the basis for the world wide web.  WWW (html docs) are tied together by hyperlinks.</p>

<h2>How we see what we see</h2>
<p>Our <em>browsers</em> (ie, firefox, safari, chrome, etc.) send <em>http</em> requests over the <em>internet</em> to <em>servers</em> containing the HTML documents of the content we are interested in seeing.  The servers send the requested documents back to our browsers, which inturn interpret the document, and we see the programmers vision.</p> 

<h2>How browsers see what they see</h2>
Computers are literally literal. They do as they are told and <em>cannot compute</em> if not told in a language that they understand.
It is the programmers job to <em>tell</em> the computer what to do in a way that they can understand the instructions and in turn follow the instructions.
<h3>HTML-Basics</h3>
<p>HTML documents are text documents written in a language that the computer (browsers) can understand called <b>HTML</b>.  An HTML document is made of several elements but what we see is mainly contained in the <  body  > element.</p>
<p>HTML is broken down into text, tags, and hyperlinks.</p>
<p>
<b>Text</b> = what you see<br>
<b>Tags</b> = markup; what it looks like<br>
<b>Hyperlinks</b> = References to other documents; could be other html docs, videos, music, images, etc.
</p>
<p>There are many, many, many tags and attributes. As you dabble in html, you will surely memorize the commonly used tags, but a quick <b><em>GOOGLE</em></b> search can help us out with those that we don't use as much.</p>
